        <h2>
            If you are a student at Southeast Polk, then aquire a physical copy of The Che Spark from a Vanguard Party Memeber! <br> help is also appreciated in reprinting copies of issues. We do not have a mass printer to use and all of our resources are from out of pocket expenses. All issues of The Che Spark are free for everyone to read, but you may feel free to donate to the party and its cause.
        </h2>
        <p>
            note: we are not trotskyists. We use our newspaper to help spread information regarding the party and events that happen through a socialist perspective so that students may have a better understanding of these events with a Marxist way of thinking.
