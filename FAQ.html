        Q: Isn't Communism when the government owns everything?
    </h3>
    <p>
        A: No. Not exactly. True Communism is when there isn't even a government; there is no state, money, or social classes. Socialism however is when private property (property used for profit under capitalsim i.e., factories) becomes public property (in which the state owns it. The state is democratically ran by the people, so the people indirectly own the means of productions; in this context what is public property). So instead of a few rich guys at the top who run the means of productions and own private property (which is capitalism), the entire population owns the means of production (socialism, AKA what you consider to be when "under communism the government owns everything").

    <h3>
        Q: But doesn't socialism not work?
    </h3>
    <p>
        A: No. Socialism does work! Socialism has shown massive amounts of improvement for nations that implement it. These nations experience massive growth in the literacy rate, lower rates of suicide, absence of absolute poverty, anti-imperialistic policies, growth in life expectancy, exceptionally great economy, Free healthcare, free education, guarenteed housing and food for all citizens, improved quality of manufactured items, absence of extraction of surplus value, lower work hours, higher wages, democratic work place where bosses are elected by the workers, etc. Socialism has immensely worked when it has been used. The reason why almost all socialist nations today have fallen is because of imperialistic nations; especially the United States who have used extensive imperialistic measures to take down these socialist nations since they pose a threat to the profit diven motives of the United States.

    <h3>
        Q: well, even if socialism sounds good capitalism is good enough. Why would we want to switch to socialism?
    </h3>
    <p>
        A: This is preciously the thing: capitalisn <i>isn't</i> good enough. Absolute poverty, guarantee of imperialistic force to export capital to expand market (thus resulting in useless murders, exploitation of workers, slow destruction of the planet for profit, etc.), homelessness, extraction of surplus value, useless goods produced, over production, wealth inequality, absence of true democracy, no representation in the work field for workers, and currently <b>the destruction of our own planet as we speak</b> are just <i>some</i> examples of why capitalism isn't "good enough". Capitalsim has done its deed and has "worked" for us long enough. It's time to move on though. We need a better system to run society and the answer is socialism.

    <h3>
        Q: But wont a Communist party just install a one party state, essentially fascism, once it gets to power after the revolution?
    </h3>
    <p>
        A: Everything but the fascist part is true. "But that's totalitarianism! The communist party will control everything and there are no other partys to vote for!" This whole mode of thinking comes from Americans who view their two party system as being "democratic" where these two parties represent different ideas and by voting on them to see which gets into power will decide which certain views will be enacted once they are in power. How does this make any sense at all though? Even George Washington warned of a two party system and opposed the idea of it. The purpose of the Communist Party after the revolution kind of fades away anyways as the people run and represet it. Engels, and as Lenin had covered the topic for him, had described that the state (the government, military, etc) will start to wither away after the revolution under socialism. The purpose of the Communist Party under capitalism is to organize the masses to lead revolution. Afterwards, the party kind of becomes a product of history and simply stands as a way to organize the state as it maintains under socialism until the international revolution around the globe dominates. This "One party state" is still democratic however. All views will be addressed through the communist party as it is entirely comprised of any individuals democratically elected into the government. There is no fighting over different parties as instead all views between different parties are shared under one; the Communist party, of which is ran by the people themselves. If the nominated people running the party are not running the nation according to how the people feel that they should be, then the people have the right to address these issues and to critisize the people in the party. The nominated individuals running the party then respond and fix said issues. If not, then the people have the right to kick out individuals of who did not correctly represent the people and their interests. This is how a socialist state with the Communist Party running the state works. The party itself doesn't have any power and instead the people who are democratically elected to it have the power to fix and advance the nation. This in of itself directly contradicts fascism and totalitarianism. As such, socialism is not when "a totalitarianist one party state where the communist party controls everything".
