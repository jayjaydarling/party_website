        The Revolutionary Students Party is a political organization with the aim of teaching students the truth behind Marxism (ML, MLM, ect) and spreading class consciousness. We hope to show students that schools teach anti-communist propaganda as a form of indoctrination, and we try to educate them on facts in regards to capitalism and socialism.

        The Revolutionary Students Party has existed since 2023.

        The Revolutionary Students Party effectively is a vanguard party (as described in Lenin's writtings) that educates students. We frequently talk among students and members alike on topics of capitalism, socialism, class consciousness, ect. We write booklets and critique each other on our ideas and writtings and vote on elements of the party (i.e., how the website should look).
