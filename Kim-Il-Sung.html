<p>
    Despite the political divide between Korea where anti-Communism is heavily present in the south, there has historically been a large amount of communists in the south (there is still a presence of Communists in the south today, however legal action by the South Korean government is sporatically taken out on them; directly contradicting the South Korean constitution which 'guarantees' freedom of speech).
</p>
<p>
    Following the abolishment of Japanese imperialism the entire Korean peninsula had become independant. The north democratically elected a socialist government (and enjoyed it for about two months before the Americans invaded) while the South had been having elections of their own. The Communists had won the elections (democratically) and out of fear the Americans had immediantly abolished the elections and had an American military dictatorship set up in the south. So much for "freedom" and "democracy" that the U.S. stands for. Many Communists in the south after protesting following the creation of the Republic of Korea (contemporary South Korea by the U.S.) were killed by the South Korean government.

    Regardless if your a communist or even a leftist this alone should be a clear sign for anyone to see the United States' and South Korea's true colors (of which there are extensively more examples).

            Kim-Il Sung (Korean: 김일성) was a politician, orator, writer, guerilla soldier, general, president, and is the Eternal Leader of Korea. Kim-Il Sung served as the president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK; North Korea) from 1972 to 1994. He is honored in the DPRK, (secretly) in South Korea, and all over the world by workers alike for his commitment towards liberating Korea and her people.
